function output = ratGLM( spikes,distrib,link,backstep,forwardstep)
%
%This function takes a .nev file with data on neural spiking and 
%torques and generates a generalized linear model with the link function
%'link' and the error distribution 'distrib'. It uses the spiking of
%all units except the one being predicted at 'backstep' previous time
%steps. In other words, it predicts the behaviour of unit N using the 
%behavior of all units j!=N at times t-1, t-2,... t-backstep. It 
%outputs the actual spiking behavior, the names of the spikes, the
%matrix of spikes at [t-1|t-2|...|t-backstep] for predictions (called
%'spikesprime', the %coefficient matrix for predicting behavior, the 
%original deviances of the data, the deviances of the data with a single 
%unit removed from the model, the change in deviance between the current 
%and reduced model, the p values from a chi squared test looking at the 
%change in deviance,a smoothed version of the actual spiking train to use 
%in statistical testing, a matrix of the predicted firing rate ('muhat'), 
%and the r squared value of a linear fit plotting the predicted vs. the 
%actual firing rate (they should be ~the same, and a higher r^2 indicates
%a better predictive power in the model
